A browser-based image editor built with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and React. Upload an image and apply filters, transform it, and interact with it in real time via a GPU-accelerated canvas.

## Live Demo

- **[Live Application Demo](https://pettor.github.io/app-pixi-image-editor/app/)** - See the main application
- **[Storybook Component Library](https://pettor.github.io/app-pixi-image-editor/storybook/)** - Explore the component documentation

## Features

- **GPU-accelerated rendering** via PixiJS WebGL canvas
- **Image filters** — blur, brightness, contrast, saturation, pixelate, and more via `pixi-filters`
- **Transform tools** — rotate (CW/CCW), flip horizontal/vertical, fit-to-view, fullscreen
- **Zoom controls** — pan and zoom via `pixi-viewport`
- **Drag-and-drop upload** — drop an image file directly onto the home screen
- **Dark/light theme** toggle
- **PWA** — installable and works offline
- **Internationalization** — all UI strings managed via React Intl

## GitHub Actions Setup

### CI

On every pull request, the `main` workflow runs lint, build, component tests, and E2E tests.

To enforce these as required checks:

1. **Settings** → **Actions** → enable "Allow all actions"
2. **Settings** → **Rules** → create a branch protection rule targeting the default branch with required status checks: `Lint`, `Build`, `Test Components`, `Test E2E`

### GitHub Pages Deployment

Merging to `main` triggers the `deploy` workflow, which builds the app and publishes to the `deploy/main` branch.

Setup:
1. **Settings** → **Pages** → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `deploy/main`
